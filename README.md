This project is heavily inspired by a course on making apps with flutter on [fireship.io](https://fireship.io/)

### Made my own

I have taken the liberty of changing a lot of what is taught in the course to somewhat make the app my own.

#### What I have done

- Made a Theme Switcher with default theme support
- Made changes to database to store images on the cloud instead of locally
- Updated the UI to my liking
